The isPalindrome method converts (see convert helper method) both strings. The method checks to see if both strings are of equal length, then uses a for-loop to
compare the first character of str1 with the last letter of str2, then the second letter of str1 to the second-to-last letter of str2, and so on. If the string lengths
or letters do not match, the isPalindrome boolean variable is set to false, and will return false. If not, the method will return true.
