Uses the BFS traversal method. 

Create a queue and add the root. While the queue is not empty, add the current node's children to the back of the queue,
and its value to the level list. Keep track of the current level using a for-loop. Move on to the next node in the queue. 
Repeat until there are no longer any nodes in the queue. Return the final list of lists.
