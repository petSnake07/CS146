Method takes note of the original color and uses a helper method to flood fill the image (and returns the updated image). 
The helper method checks to see if (1) the pixel is out of bounds and (2) the pixel color does not match the original color. 
If the pixel passes these checks, the color is updated and the method calls itself for the pixel above, below, left, and right.
