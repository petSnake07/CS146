The method first represents the wells and pipes as an adjacency matrix. Then, it runs Prim's algorithm to determine the total cost
of the minimum spanning tree by iterating through the matrix, using the greedy approach to choose the cheapest edges and updating
when cheaper paths are discovered. Finally, it returns the total cost.
