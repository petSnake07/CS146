The minMeetingRooms method first creates sorted arrays of the start and end times. It will then iterate through the list 
of start times, and compare each time with the current end time. If the start time is less than the end time, it means that 
there is currently a meeting in progress and another room is needed (roomsNeeded++). If the start time is greater than or 
equal to the end time, however, it means that there are no meetings in progress (and the end-time index will be incremented). 
Finally, the method returns the final value of roomsNeeded.
