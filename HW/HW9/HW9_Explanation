The lowestCommonAncestor method uses the binary search tree property of the left and right child being less than and greater 
than the parent, respectively. By recursively comparing the values of the targets and the parent to see if both values are less
than or greater than the parent, it determines if both targets are in the same subtree. Once one target is less than the parent 
and the other greater, it indicates it has found the least common ancestor and returns the root.
