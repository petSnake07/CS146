findPair method converts (see convert helper method) an integer array into a hashmap, 
with keys equal to the associated number in the array and values equal to the target - number at the key. 
The method then checks each key to see if its value is also an existing key. 
If found, the key and value are stored, and "isFound" is set to true.
If not, the loop continues until one is found, or none work.
In the end, the program prints "isFound". If true, it also prints the key-value pair. If false, it simply prints "false".
