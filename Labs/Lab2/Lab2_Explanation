The isAnagram method takes two input Strings and converts them into a list of letters (see stringConverter method).
Using a while-loop, the loop takes the "i" index of the a list and checks if the other list contains the element. 
If yes, the method removes those letters from each list and checks the next letter. 
If no, "i" increments so the next element can be checked. 
The method returns true if both lists have 0 elements. Otherwise, it returns false.
