The isValidBST method uses a helper method requiring the root of the subtree, the maxmimum bound, and the minimum bound. 
This method recursively checks to see if the current node is less than the parent if it is a left child, or greater than 
the parent if it is a right child. The min and max values are updated based on the child's placement (left or right child)
and the current value of the subtree root. Finally, once the method reaches the end of a subtree (as indicated by a null root),
it returns true, indicating there were no issues. Otherwise, it returns false.
