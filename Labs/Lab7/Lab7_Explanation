The findTheCity method uses Floyd-Warshall's algorithm(*) to create a table of edges for each city. Using the table, 
nested for-loops iterate through cities, keeping track of the number of neighbors they have, the city with the least
number of neighbors and greatest city #, and its neighbor count. Finally, the method returns the city num with the 
minimum number of neighbors. 

(*) The Floyd-Warshall algorithm in this method creates a table and fills it with the max integer or 0, if the city leads
to itself. Then, it fills in the given edges. Lastly, it iterates through the table once more to update weights and discover 
new ones.
